## _The One Place Solution to Satisfy your Hunger_

This is the repository for the front-end of the food delivery website developed using Tailwind CSS, JSX, React.js.
The website allows users to browse restaurants, view their menus, place orders, and track the delivery status. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JSX using the React.js framework, while the backend is developed using Spring Boot.
## Tech Stack

Our team at Bhook-lagi has used these technologies to build this application :

- [ **React bootstrap JS** ] - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces!
- [ **Tailwind CSS** ] -  Utility-based framework based on CSS.
- [ **MySQL Spring Boot** ] - Spring Boot provides seamless integration MySQL, making it easier to                            develop robust and scalable Web applications.

## Getting Started :

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run to view our project :

```sh
npm i
npm start
```


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
